# Sparkler

A SuperCollider parser library.

Sparkler uses ANTLR to generate SuperCollider parsers in C++, Python,
and JavaScript. We also plan to add unofficial parser generator support
to ANTLR to generate a SuperCollider parser in SuperCollider.

# Using the Generated Parsers

# Rebuilding The Parser Libraries

## macOS
